the urllink oqo , the small devic that might look like a small sharp wizard or a palmpilot with a keyboard , is start to urllink make a splash in the electron world . As I wrote about earlier thi month ( may 12 ) , the oqo is a devic which fit in your pocket but run full-on window XP . predict : devic of thi size and capabl are go to make a big impact to geekhead and businesspeopl alik . whi buy a palm or pocketpc devic which ha a watered-down oper system when you can bring the full window OS with you ? Go on vacat , go to the coffe shop , whatev . other devic maker are also go in thi direct as I mention on urllink may 25 . what could make thi predict fail ? If the make themselv price these thing too high . ideal they should be in the $ 500-1000 rang , but I predict they 'll be higher . most peopl wo n't buy in at that point . At ani rate , thi is good news for those of us who like our data to go .

peopl still look for gmail invit . urllink www.gmailswap.com is nice but offer not much help sinc it 's delug by peopl ask for invit . googl 's urllink own blog doe n't give ani insight at all ( and I would think thi would be prime materi for a blog ) . A urllink site in the UK which host discuss on all thing googl is say that urllink blogger user are get a new round of invit . No confirm though . and they do point out the vast number of peopl sign up for blogger and then creat empti blog -- not too attract real estat for our internet neighborhood . So , meanwhil , the [ virtual ] world wait and wait for the elus invit , or the day when the door open and it 's a real parti . 
A devic that fit in your pocket , run full window XP , can attach to a full-siz display/projector and handl all your calendar , web surf , mp3 playlist ? they call it the urllink flipstart , from a compani call vulcan . It 's founder ? A guy call paul allen . rememb him ? He co-found a littl compani call microsoft . I want one of these devic ; sadli I just know they 'll cost at least $ 1000 and probabl more . soni is urllink prepar to announc one and it 's go to go for $ 2700 . yike .

OK , fan -- the final episod of urllink 24 season 3 is tonight . person I think either toni or michel will die . call it a hunch ; we 'll see if it prove correct . 
OK , so now I 'm realli get upset . I realli want to get my hand on googl 's urllink gmail . I had read that the user of blogger were get first dib as part of the beta test ( blogger be own by googl -- make sens ) . So , I had a blogger account that rare got use , and I start use it , hope to get the elus and much sought after invit . No go . So , I figur ( and read someplac els ) that it must be for the veri activ blogger user who post often . So I wa bum , but at least I thought I had the answer . I continu to use blogger in the hope that sometim soon I 'll achiev a signific number of post to warrant an invit and also becaus the servic is pretti cool and I 'm consid thi time my own `` blogger beta test '' . now , howev , I read urllink thi post that anoth guy wa in the same situat as me , with a dormant blogger account that he start use , and he actual got the gmail invit . right away . seeth . anger . bah . 
the charact of chloe on 24 is one which you either love or hate . most peopl hate her . she 's in your face , a bit bitchi and gener unlik . howev , there is a group of peopl that appar urllink think she 's hot . check it out . 
well , after much search through the internet , I 've come up with a timelin on when googl 's gmail might be avail to the public . you know by thi point , after all the post I 've made and the interest I 've taken in it , that I 'd like to get an account . My revisionbar.com account is n't that great of a client , and although it doe support pop3 , download messag directli to my PC ha introduc virus more than onc . So , it seem as if a webmail solut is my best bet , at least until the spam situat die down ( if ever ) . enter gmail , from googl . I 'd love to get it , but so far I 've onli found 2 refer as to when it might be avail to the whole world . 90 day from it 's invitation-onli start ( that would put it at the end of june ) and an articl that state `` late summer '' ( -- > urllink go to articl ) thi make me unhappi . I realli do n't want to wait that long . [ sigh ] . 
So , it look like some of the cast of 24 urllink wo n't be back next season . No mention of chloe though . I 'd love to see her get the ax . 
So , would you urllink give up a kidney for a gmail account ? I did n't think so . check out urllink gmail swap for thi and other odditi . 
A sunday post , no less . are n't you all special . actual , I 'm just doodl around on the net and ran across thi so figur I 'd post it . palm ha urllink won their case against xerox , who claim they stole the palmpilot handwrit recognit system , grafitti , from them . I believ thi wa an appeal case , so it will be interest to see what happen next . the score is now 1-1 . 
rumor are swirl about urllink dell possibl want to acquir palmon , the arm of palm that make the hardwar devic . while palm 's ( and palmon 's ) futur ha been in question for some time as a result of lacklust sale and devic that were bourgeoi at best , those time had appear to be over . the review of the entir urllink tungsten line , along with the record-set sale of it 's urllink zire line , have been key element in palmon 's recoveri . In effect , most fan had thought the worst had pass . So , then , the question : whi a buyout now ? and can palmon effect hold the dealmak at the door and say `` No thank '' ?

well , gmail fever ha struck . peopl want to get their hand on 1gb of email storag space so bad that at least one person who ha an inivit from googl to sign up ha decid to auction it off . go price as of thi write is $ 16 . got ta love capit . accord to the auction , it will make you popular with the women .

I 'm still look around for a new email servic . I may actual have to wait until urllink googl 's gmail is releas to the public . after everyth I 've read , I think that 's the servic I want to use . I at least want to give it a tri . after all , they 're give their user a urllink full terabyt of space now ( up from the stagger 1gb which they start out with ) but it 's still debat whether that limit will stay . 1gb is more than enough anyway . I wa hope that sinc I 'm use blogger now , googl would offer me the chanc to sign up for gmail . that 's what wa report by mani blogger user , but so far no window ha pop up which offer thi . mayb it will happen later , or mayb I 'll just sign up when the floodgat open .

lot of you may be wonder what thi is all about . A whole new format , audio link ... what is up ? well , here 's the stori . I 'm experi with a new format and new content deliv system for the revis bar . current , and histor , I have hand-cod the file ( which I love , by the way ) and manual ftp-ed the file over to the server . howev , with the hand code and manual manipul of the server came certain restrict . for instanc , I would like to implement a `` talkback '' system where user , that is -- ani user , with or without permiss , could send comment about someth I 've written and have it post to the site . that prove harder than I thought , and so I start look around . urllink blogger provid that function and much more . check it out : the abil to post from ani PC via a web browser . No file need to be on the PC your ' e sit at becaus they 're all on the blogger server the abil to post from a handheld devic ( palm , pocketpc , etc ) the abil to send an email , with an includ blog entri , directli to your site and have it post . the abil to post from a cellular phone . the entri get save as .mp3 file and your site visitor can listen to your audio post . there 's one on thi site right now . automat archiv of content . after a month , all the content goe from the front page to an archiv section to make room for the newer stuff . automat . veri cool . So , the bottom line is I 'm tri thi format out , and I encourag you to also . If it all work out well , I may switch to use thi and have the full revis bar run thi way instead of just a subset as it is now . for now though , I encourag you to brows the page , check out some of the link , and definit tri the comment section . It 's the one featur I 'm the most pump about , becaus it could give me good feedback about who 's read thi site . If peopl comment , I can begin to get a feel for who my reader are and what they 'd like to see . We can also get that whole commun thing go , which I think is essenti to a good site . enjoy it , and let me know what you think .

I just check anoth of my yahoo account , interestingli enough not to see if the space limit had been put it into effect , but to actual check my inbox . To my surpris , I now have 100 MB and a newer interfac . awesom . howev , for some reason , my other yahoo account , which is much older ( open somewher around 1997 ) , ha not gotten the space increas yet . My guess is that either 1 ) they hate me and want my account to remain grandfath in at a smaller MB limit or 2 ) that they 're gradual make the chang to all the account and just have n't gotten to my other account yet . I choos to think that it 's option number 1 . for all you urllink yahoo mail user , go check out your inbox and see what 's up . there may be a big surpris wait for you . 
look like yahoo 's urllink up the ant for it 's free email servic today . subscrib will get 100 MB , and yahoo say it 's go to clean up the interfac , which ha long been derid as clutter with advertis . thi is yahoo 's attempt to thwart googl 's urllink gmail , or at least keep the subscrib it ha . I just check my yahoo account , but the limit ha n't been rais yet . mayb it goe into effect later today . 
Oh , yeah , I 'm on urllink gmail now babi ! have n't had hardli ani time to play with it yet , but I 'm in there . now come the hard work of switch all my differnet subscript so they point to my new gmail account . then we 'll see how well it hold up under some stress . you know the best part ?

In my quest for a better email provid , I decid yesterday to tri urllink spymac . what a wast . I had read on forum that the servic wa n't great , wa slow , etc , but you never know what ax these peopl have to grind when they make such comment . So , I sign up . pretti much a mistak . what I 'm left with now is an account that I 'll probabl never use and will hope get delet after a period of inact . It 's just that the servic is slow , and the interfac is pretti bare bone and not attract to use at all . It doe n't seem to support much , if ani , html mail , and you certainli ca n't compos an html mail . It 's just pain to use . So I wo n't . An interest side note is that urllink yahoo mail is look better and better as I compar it to all the other . although I predict gmail will still be better overal , yahoo 's combin of a real decent spam filter and support for html messag realli make it shine . It 's actual quit fast too , and when they increas everyon 's quota to 100 MB thi summer , it will realli be a contend . I do n't think it will be better than gmail , but mayb these combin of featur will be appeal . 
A few day ago I mention that I 've sold my handheld devic and am current deviceless . the experi ha been interest to say the least . while I am a believ in the power of these devic to store data , and also that they can be much easier and faster to use than power up your laptop to check your calendar , that conveni ha come at a price . both financi and figur . the devic are expens , and are seen as geek tool . neither of which I like , and both of which I 'd like to avoid . So , I ditch my old devic and decid to see if I could go it alon . No devic . I 'm not sure if I can . I find myself reach for one to check my calendar . To find a contact . To make a notat to myself . It 's frustrat at time and I find myself think `` just go to the store , pick out a new one and move on '' . but it 's not quit that easi . the one I would want would have to have wireless internet capabl ( wifi ) capabl , and they 're not cheap . wherea you can get a basic pda for $ 150 , I do n't want one of those . I just sold 2 devic that were better than that , so whi settl ? We 'll see in time if I can actual live without one , or if I crack and buy someth . ani bet ? leav a comment by click the comment link . ( although there may be a notic say anonym post are not allow , they are in fact fine . post away . ) ani pda suggest are fine , too . you know , just in case I decid to buy . : - ) 
yesterday I migrat the main revis bar page over to the new blogger templat . after use blogger for about a month , and figur out how it work and what the benefit were , I decid to take the plung . It 's definit a network-centr approach to do thing . I can edit thi site use ani comput , and that 's a good thing . post could n't be easier , either . I find that all in all , I post more often simpli due to the simplic afford me by the blogger methodolgi . I also hook in the older page ( pre blogger ; feb. 2000 - april 2004 ) so you 'll still be abl to access those . I chose a new templat use blogger so the old page and the newer one basic match . there are some differ , but not terribl . I feel it 's nice to have some clue to the fact that chang have been made to the site design over the year , thu provid some insight that the site is make progress . look for the older page on the right hand side under archiv -- older archiv . hope you 'll enjoy the new look as I do . thi site ha alway been an evolutionari thing for me . A way to test new thing out and see what work . although I will miss hand-cod everyth , thi will be fun for awhil and offer mani advantag , such as the abil for you to leav comment . although no one ha done so yet , I hope to get some feedback in time and build up a nice rapport with whoever read these page . enjoy . 
while continu my search for urllink gmail , I found a new site call urllink the give tree . It 's a site where peopl who want gmail can put their name on the list . peopl who are current gmail user can see your name on the list and send you your invit . the stipul is that onc you 're a regist member and get invit of your own to pass out , you 'll come back to the give tree to pass them out . thu , everybodi win . I put my name on the list and wa told there are 153 peopl ahead of me . not too bad actual . I 've been wait week alreadi , what 's a few more day or so ? I 've also read that googl ha decid to open up more invit and have given each current gmail member 3 more invit . If true , that 's good news for me and make my odd of get one better . 
the independ movi urllink supers Me is make a big splash at the box offic alreadi , and it 's onli been releas to a small number of theater . some of us ( ahem , ahem ) have been say for year that fast food place like mcdonald are bad for your health . 
bad news . there 's new warn that urllink Al qaeda will attack airlin . 
enough rant ? I still want urllink gmail . appar noth can bring me closer to thi goal . I 'm stuck wait it out for the entir summer . It 's too bad , becaus I could realli use it to consolid all my differ account . It would be big enough that I could hope go down to just one . patienc , patienc , patienc . 
look out dorothi . thi is kansa , and it 's tornado town . thi woman appar thought the correct thing to do wa to go to the urllink bathroom . she wa right . 
I 'm current palmpilot-less . I 've sold all my recent goodi on ebay . stuff that wa either outdat or infuri . My urllink palm tungsten T , my urllink audiovox maestro . with both these devic gone , I now have no more handheld to help organ my life . I 'm think about a new palm zire , or mayb an HP ipaq . two differ platform , choic to make . soni 's out of the market now and I wa pretti much set on a clie . rumor are that the price on the cli will be go down now to clear out the stock , but I 'm still not sure . buy on now just mean it 's a dead devic with no futur . 
look like I wo n't be buy a urllink soni clie handheld in the futur . 
just an fyi , still look to get into urllink gmail . and still no luck . seem invit are veri hard to come by , which may explain whi urllink ebay 's been so busi late . I 'm tempt to go to urllink spymac , which also offer 1gb of storag , but I realli like the index method that gmail use , where you do n't use folder , you assign label . guess I 'll keep wait . patienc ha it 's place . 
urllink yafro , a site where peopl can spontan post pictur of themselv and other thing that catch their interest . pictur taken while out and about with cell phone are popular on thi site , as are nude or provoc pictur , for some reason . If you 're into exhibition , check it out or start post .

I have n't post about urllink gmail much sinc get it from ksra_sra at urllink gmailswap . I guess I 've had it a littl less than a month now and it 's just fantast . I 've total dump my old email account , despit it be a pop3 compliant and be abl to download messag and read them offlin . the heck with that , I now say , sinc I got so much spam that what I wa actual download most of the time were virus . So , now I use gmail and go through the web and it 's fast . real fast . It 's so fast I hardli notic ani differ in speed between use it and eudora . now that 's cool . and with 1gb the storag is , for the most part , unlimit . Or at least I 'll never have to worri about reach my limit for say , the next 6-10 year or more . gmail ha n't pleas everyon , howev . mani privaci advoc are unhappi with the target ad that appear inlin with the messag . some even have set up site proclaim how urllink `` creepi '' gmail is . To each their own , I guess . To ksra_sra , who gave me the account , I simpli say thank you . It took me a while to creat the CD full of softwar I promis at gmailswap , but I mail it yesterday so it should be there soon . you 're urllink globe-hop right now anyway , as document in your blog , so hope you have n't miss it too much . love the urllink balloon anim , by the way .
