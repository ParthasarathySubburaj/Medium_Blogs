I do n't like the fact that whenev I open up my access log , I get overwhelm by the junk request that wast my valueabl bandwidth and harddriv space . they all tend to attempt to execut some code , which doe not exist on my linux box , and compromis my server . apach is not vulner to those iis-specif exploit , but they are annoy to hell nonetheless . A few googl search reveal that you can put a few line in the config file that match the request to a regexp and redirect them to elsewher if they are found to be malici . they do work like a charm , well , but for onli subset of the exploit . the nastiest `` search /\x90\x02\xb1\x02\xb1\x02\xb1\x02\xb1\x02 ... '' that easili take hundr of line of my valueabl log file space is still there . I 'd realli appreci if some one could suggest an easi solut to get rid of thi mess .
