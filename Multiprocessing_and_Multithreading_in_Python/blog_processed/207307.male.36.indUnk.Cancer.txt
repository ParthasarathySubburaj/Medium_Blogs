I do n't know how well known it realli is , but for the last year or so my performance-bas practic ha been get pretti weird , larg becaus I find the term practic and emerg realli annoy and stifl . I mean , I 've been perform in variou way for year , and I have no idea what emerg mean anyway , in thi context . As it happen , I decid thi would be spell cast , and that I 'd be a witch or magician somehow . the act of name and all that stuff . what ha been fun and interest is develop thi idea : I want to make ritual base perform which involv film and I 've manag to do it , somehow . It 's all been a bit of a muddl , realli , and I 've had lot of amaz support in load of way from a broad rang of peopl , but it doe seem to be work out rather well , which is fun and veri fulfil . It 's also rather weird , but go figur : I decid to embrac someth , call it magic ritual and ceas to give a fuck about have a career or anyth and whoomph , it 's all 'work ' : I get on a trade card and perform in a galleri in melbourn . amaz what happen when one get 's one 's work 'out there ' . I 'm also meet interest peopl to collabor with , and thi is great becaus I do feel veri 'alon ' in thi , or I did until veri recent anyway . anyway , thi week should see the offici public launch of the curs , or more correctli a film document of the final perform . thi should involv a public screen and a discuss forum . I feel like a sell-out , but it 's just the destruct voic tell me to chase failur and be obscur , to die unkown and unlov ... voic ? what voic ?
