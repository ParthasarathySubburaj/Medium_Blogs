welcom everyon , and thank to kev for the invit 
Ok , here we go ... so the idea ... ye , an idea , an zine , a network , a movement . As john put it , a beautifully-lam poetic gestur . As the summer approach , it is time to begin again . We 've been work for some time on make a beta-zin , a feeler , a tester of sort to see what kind of interest we can gener . and by be as alien as possibl , by talk about pain , and heartbreak and all sort of person sappi shite , we should quickli be abl to see who is genuin interest in thi - and can see through the sentimentalist bullcrap and get to the heart of the issu . what is the heart of the issu . we 're still not quit sure . but it base in two simpl idea that have creat the necess for thi moment/mov . 1 ) there is a grow , global polit movement , an avant-gard if it were , that ebb and flow , but that doe truli exist - that ha begun to bring togeth all the singule-issu activist into someth much stronger . A non-hierarch network that believ anoth world is possibl , dreamer and cynic , environmentalist and anarchist . design/art ha left them behind in narcissist ignor . sure we all made some anti-war poster , but that posit design simpli as a function tool . where did the brave , simpl , idea go ? look back to histori , to the constructivist , dadaist and situationist . design all who strove for more and less - who fought , struggl and at time triumph over languag . and then , of cours , there is the person . the person is polit , how can we see , feel , hear , that connect ? if we can commit , serious commit , to commun , to an ethic , moral even , form of commun between ourselv , between friend , lover , and parent - perhap we can see what need to be done . In honest , dialogu and love . soon , guy , soon ... . 
thi is just a test . 
the basic idea is to materialis discuss around opposit cultur - noth new , but I 'm hope I can do it in an interest way . interest , person I 'm more and more oppos to opposit cultur as a whole . rebellion and resist I think are part of the problem , not a solut . the rhetor of cours is still seduct though ... `` oppos to opposit cultur '' - that 's great man ! I suppos I agre with you somewhat , but it depend on how you defin the term . 'caus in my book , you 're all opposit babi ! like I said I think we see the same problem . but the whole thing with revolut , resist and class war is that it all still violenc and war in the end . ultim it the same rhetor that the neocon are use against islam , us vs. them . I 'm over that . there is no war to fight , other then one we start . No one is our enemi unless we make them one ... I 'm out to fix problem , not fight them . of cours , of cours . and well said . I do n't think of opposit approach as inher violent , though I do see your point on an ideolog level . nonetheless , there reach a point when a `` NO '' is necessari in order to redirect dialogu , rais question and challeng institut . Do n't get me wrong , I realis the absurd and pure romantic of what I 'm tri to do here , but I also realis that if I do n't do thi while I 'm in my twenti , I 'll regret it in my thirti . `` what better place than here , what better time than now ... . '' hell yeah ! pretti much my philosophi too . these are the time for risk . 
It 's come to my attent that my roughli hewn out manifesto below may come across as alien . It wa my intent to simpli get all the thought that were in my head out . though I am still confid in the principl behind what I am propos I 'm tri to find a better way to formul them so that it can be more broadli access and engag . but first I need to put my offici propos togeth , and then I will tri and get back to it . just so peopl know , the wheel are in motion . give it anoth week . At the bottom of all thi , all I 'm look for is dialogu , let 's talk . I now know that I need to look at more specif way of engag peopl . I 've sent out a broad call for `` rebel call '' or quotat as a start point . either send them my way , or post respons below . thank . 
four minut to midnight is an idea , a 'zine , a network , a movement ; a stupidli beauti , lame , poetic gestur flung at the face of a stifl cultur of neo-liber . four minut to midnight is the moment when we begin to speak openli again , the moment when we realis time is run out , when we no longer allow cynic and fear to silenc our voic , when we sing , danc , yell , whisper , laugh and cri , when we commit to do whatev we can to resuscit digniti and hope in a cultur that is gear to make us feel inadequ and insignific . when we fight to win . At the centr of thi , we fundament commit to dialogu and commun action , to the radic and transform potenti of commun . from thi central commit , two basic principl emerg . the first is a recognit and celebr of the exist and growth of an intern opposit cultur . and a recognit of the necess for cultur produc to do far more in engag with , reflect upon , and develop thi cultur . not onli as voice-giv or tool-mak , but in directli contribut to the languag of progress resist . not to speak for , but to speak with . the second principl is base in the recognit of the failur of the classic and modernist grand-narr of the past . In reaction to thi , we find the avant-gard posit now resid in the develop of micro-narr , in the multitud of person stori and journey . divers is surviv , and subject is a critic weapon against hegemoni . howev thi engag with autonom subject categor refus to fall into the trap of relativ and it associ flatten of valu . In order to escap thi trap , we endeavour to work in the space creat by the interrel of these two basic principl . To paraphras the women 's movement , `` the person is polit . '' We see thi space and our posit within it as the start point for genuin social dialogu and our assault on the industri of cultur . furthermor , cast all sentiment asid , we call for a deep commit to each other , to love in onli it most honest dimens , and from thi , the belief that togeth , we can chang the world . 

i get the pencil and we 'll draw a new world . 
A big thank you to all those who have particip in our first round/issu and to those that have shown interest in the project . A .pdf of the first issu is now up in the urllink document section of the site and print version are on the way . those that would like print version , pleas feel free to contact myself or urllink john , though as our budget is non-exist the 'offici ' print run will be quit small . In proper diy fashion howev , we encourag you to download the .pdf and print/distribut your own if you feel so inclin . the first issu is a rather loos assemblag of materi , from quot sent in and found , odd bit of write that I 've had kick around and comment by particip respond to the question `` what 's wrong ? '' In edit and design the first issu , disson , john and I discov some theme in all thi materi and tri to structur a loos themat narr with the content . though we activ tri not to make them explicit ( to maintain the open natur of dialogu ) , we hope that they might reveal themselv subtli and provid a way forward in thi project . I wo n't deni my activ role as the main editor/design , and the express of my voic and intent behind the public , but I do hope that those who have particip feel that they 've made activ contribut and will be encourag to respond to how I 've work with their idea and word . I apologis for the mani respons that have been left out due to the necess for concis and narr , yet they have all help to inform the develop of the project and may be includ in futur issu . I 'm pleas by how peopl have react to thi project so far and hope that with the releas of the first issu , you 'll be encourag to particip even more . I realis that the lack of specif of subject matter ha perhap been a bit of a barrier to realli gener ani dialogu , yet at the same time I think thi open natur is essenti to the philosophi behind the project . I will be make more specif post for us to respond to , but I also hope that other will be encourag to take the initi and bring up what they think belong to thi project . the question now is how to move forward . It is my intent to put out anoth issu in about three week time , befor the end of august . I 'd like to quit liter build on the first issu for thi and I encourag peopl to go through the issu and react , in whatev way they find appropri , to ani of the content within it . find someth that engag you , a quot , an idea , a random line of text , a word even , and see if you can build on it . thi could take the form of a written respons , anoth quot , an illustr , a photograph , etc . the most import thing for me right now is for us not to censor ourselv , and to just find a way to express ourselv honestli , to tri and build a dialogu around the thing we care deepli about ; love , joy , pain , polit , design , coffe , teddi bear , and especi the point where all these thing converg . 
I 'd like to open our convers with a broad but import question . what 's wrong ? take the question how you want it , but a gut-react would be prefer . describ you 're immedi physic surround , and tri and answer the question honestli , from whatev perspect you want . pleas also take the time to read other peopl 's comment and build from them if possibl . 
It ha to start somewher , It ha to start somehow , what better place than here , what better time than now . - rage against the machin pleas post your quotat in the comment of thi thread . I 'm current compil the one I 've receiv by email and will post them here as well . In addit to post quotat , pleas also respond to ani of them that you might particularli like or hate . just a quick note about the intent behind thi . 1 ) some may question the rhetor natur of thi approach , especi with these quotat taken out of context . though I agre that thi is a concern , I nonetheless believ in the necess for poetic rhetor , rhetor can caus movement , and movement creat chang . 2 ) By gather these togeth from divers sourc , I hope we can make evid the vibrant histori and contemporari express of dissid cultur . 3 ) ask for quot seem an easi and fun place to start ! 
I 'm `` offici '' start thi project as of today . mani thank to all those who have shown interest and kept me from turn my thesi project into anoth piec of pretti but pointless design . So the question is , how do we start ? for those that do n't want to go through the ( albeit short ) length of my propos , what I 'm hope we can do here is engag in a dialogu about our person experi of opposit cultur , and then materialis it . now the question ha come up mani time , what is opposit cultur ? I have no simpl answer , though a good overview might be the book urllink We are everywher . howev , more relevantli , I think what I 'm realli talk about here is simpli the gather of littl moment when we say to ourselv `` no , thi is not how the world should be ... '' but equal , the moment of ecstaci when we realis the freedom we have , when we feel the fragil beauti of the world , and when we then make the commit to make sure these moment wo n't be taken away from us and other . So , the question remain , how do we start ? well , I 've decid upon a fluid plan of action that is open to modif and discuss . first , I 've sent out a call for `` rebel call '' and have been compil them . I 'd like peopl to take the time to tri and come up with a coupl more that realli mean someth to them and either post them in the thread abov or urllink email them to me . within the next two week I will compil the quot , along with some other text , and put togeth our first issu of the 'zine . which I will then send back out to you guy in search of respons , be they textual , visual , audio , etc ... . I 'll collect those respons and we 'll do it all again . I 'll also be post other dialogu topic on thi site and would like to just encourag peopl to visit regularli and respond directli in a spirit of open commun . let 's see if we can build someth here . thank 
My thesi propos for thi project can now be found in the document section . for those that have been confus by what I 'm tri to do here , it might help to have a quick look through it , though equal it may not . Do n't let the structure/languag scare you , you got ta do what you got ta do for school , but make no mistak , what we 're do here is tri to start a movement . pleas post ani comment , question and critic below .
