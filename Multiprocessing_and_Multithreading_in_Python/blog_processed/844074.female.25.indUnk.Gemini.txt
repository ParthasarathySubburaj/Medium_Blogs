the last few day , I 've been spend way too much time build ... and build ... and build . Oi . I did manag to hang out at a coupl show and tell with zap , but ! the fruit of my labor shall soon be tast ! Oh how sweet they shall be . alright , so I 'm go overboard tri to build on my littl 512 parcel of land . I 've had a lot of fun though , and it teach me a bit about 3d world-build , object manipul , and textur . perhap on a small level , but a level nonetheless ! I 've come to greatli appreci the object creation toolset in SL , as it realli is easi to use onc you get the hang of it . and after countless hour tri to build someth resembl urllink a hous , I 've gotten the hang of it . technic , there will be three floor to it.. somehow . I got a urllink stroke of geniu and decid to `` dig out a basement '' for even more varieti in theme . 512 is n't that big , onc you start let your eye pop out of your head , and I want as much varieti as I can get , in thi littl lot . I have a feel it will end up lean toward `` gothic '' though . but not overli so.. graveyard and such are a bit overboard for me . I 'll keep it nice and neat I think . there 's a lot of work to do , and when I 'm finish , I plan to publish a more detail articl on it , featur specif , some textur use , and what not . but for now , just a tast . 
and so it seem that I 've actual manag to finish thi layout today . mani thank to all the templat author that have submit their templat to blogger . I learn a lot , probabl more than I had bargain for . I think everyth 's working.. hope . ^.^ I had to complet redo the templat , as it 's been practic forev sinc I last use blogger or blogger code . needless to say , it did kick my ars until I realiz I 'd have to steer all of the site 's content with the style-sheet . ewp . No hot-wir thi time ! A few tweak here and there , and I think I can probabl make everyth work in both IE in addit to firefox ( the browser I primarili use ) . content come soon ! and there 's lot of it . 
today went by faster than a speed bullet . good . In ani case , at least I got way more done than I thought I would . while mill about my hous in poliahu , I check the event calendar , and notic a littl goth get-togeth wa in 2 hour . first of all , I 'm not exactli a goth , I would n't call myself a goth ... but consid my second life center around a shadi near-vampir with black hair and pale skin , and a love of the color black ... I figur hey , I can dig it . needless to say I 'm sort of `` half goth '' ... dig the dark , too lazi to make it my life goal . ; ) I had noth to wear though . there wa go to be `` best outlandish costum '' contest , but I wa n't overli concern with that . I just want someth neat to wear besid my pleather pant and top . I also did n't want to go buy someth . I 'm realli stingi when it come to clothing.. part of me just want to make my own stuff . I spent about an hour on a littl urllink blood-reddish number . It wa also the first real skirt I tackl . I wa a bit proud of myself for get the skirt right on the first tri , normal I have to re-edit and re-edit to get seam correct . the top also turn out great onc I line up the seam . thi particular top is base on my leather bra . I like it so much that I 'll be save that alpha for futur design . almost tatter , slightli gauzi , dried-blood red 'skirt ' , check . match sleeveless top with spider clasp in back , check . mockup black lace stock , check . thigh-high leather boot , check ! I head over to the pit and proceed to partay . unfortun , the owner wa n't around and the poor land-stream wa set to some hip-hop/pop station . kinda kill the goth mood , but urllink we had fun . pancak stryker took first prize , and so ... she had a cute fluffi periodish gown . It wa nice get out again , I have n't been to mani event in total and can easili becom a reclus if left to my own machin ( read : texturing/build ) . come up next ? A close look at a bodi skin ... 
today did n't start off to my like , but after a small nap ( to get rid of that `` must be a cold '' bodi ach ) , thing pick up rather well ! and even though I 've spent a grand estim total of 300 L $ , I 'm fairli happi with thi week 's work . the hous wa realli begin to annoy me , as I just did n't know where to go with it , wa run out of prim-spac , and realli want to have at least a minim amount of prim-spac left for futur item creation . I ad a front `` entranc '' , urllink anoth paint , a bed , and a desk . the bed wa soooo much fun to make , too . but today and yesterday wa spent with textur . mostli myself ( bodi skin ) , and develop a clean bra alpha . first , I decid that some realist breast were necessari . uhm , mainli for my own amus , as I do n't think I could ever go around nude anywher ! howev , they do look great with semi-rev cloth . I still have urllink some tweak to do , though , especi around the inner thigh . I 'm at least done with the urllink facial part of it . the skin is loos base upon a charact I play in anarchi onlin , and while the idea is similar , I took off with it and alter to my own desir , ad much more color contrast , peach-hu blush area on the skin , etcetera . I mean , wow , give me the chanc to fulli visual flesh out a charact I 've had in my head for 6 year ? ! hello nurs ! I ca n't wait until I perfect that skin though , onc everyth 's in the right spot , all that 'll be need are tone and hue adjust if I make ani other avatar ... well , femal avatar . I intend , in the near futur , to alter it to fit a male avatar ... I 'm a sucker for a good look vampir , for instanc . befor dinner time roll around though , I did finish my urllink bra textur at least ! It match my leather panti . *nod sagely* what 's amus about all thi is , I do n't care much about style , fashion , or cloth in my `` 1st life '' . I guess it 's the artist in me ; visual freedom is intox .
