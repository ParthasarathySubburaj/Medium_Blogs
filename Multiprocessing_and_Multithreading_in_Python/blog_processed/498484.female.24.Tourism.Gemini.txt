I 'm still in the wheel area . most of my friend have gone . all I do is work and work and work . I found the man I would marri . unfortun he is gay , veri gay . So I 'm trap in thi cycl . Is it worth it to be 24 and a supervisor at a hotel in wheel , just to get experi ? Or rather should I move to the carolina and hope for the best . I 've gotten everi job I have appli for . I 'm at a crossroad . To stay in wheel and get the manag experi or say screw it , I 'm 24 it time to move away . If I had a partner in crime to run away with I would .
