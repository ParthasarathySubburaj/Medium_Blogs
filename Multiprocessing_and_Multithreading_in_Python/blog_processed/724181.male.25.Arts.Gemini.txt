I 'm suppos to be shoot the open scene of my movi thi weekend , howev I 'm not sure that it will happen becaus not all of my prop have arriv yet . At thi point I can either drive to atlanta tomorrow ( about 5 hour each way ) or wait 'til next weekend to shoot . gah , that no good either , I alreadi have a project that I 'm shoot for someon els next weekend . now I have a conundrum . I 'm think I might just make the drive so I can shoot on sunday . well , that kind of took the wind out of my sail damn , I use to be jazz .

It 's insan realli I have never realli enjoy work , but now I love it ! after year of dream of direct project I 'm final get to do it as my occup . It 's been over a year sinc I 've had a `` real '' job , I 've either done photographi or film project sinc then . I feel so lucki , even though I know it 's not luck . It 's just have the ball to do what you want to do . not to boast or anyth , but I am proud of the fact that I have n't given in and gotten a regular job ( even though I 've been tempt to sever time , becaus , in a way it 'd be easier to give up my dream and just work in a factori ) thank you to everybodi who ha support me in the past few year , I truli appric you all believ in me and my silli littl movi idea . 
music : 1 . televis - marque moon thi is just a fantast album from 1977 that realli presag the current indi sound . 2 . ben harper and the innoc criminals- live from mar amaz style and soul . one disc with the full band one disc with just ben and a guitar . the set list is a good retrospect of the first sever album with some cover thrown in . 3 . frou frou - detail some of the most emot electron music thi side of bjork ( who you should also probabl check out ) . 4 . matthew sweet - girlfriend , alter beast , 100 % fun A trifecta of nearli perfect album . beauti craft pop gem and realli great album structur . 5 . afghan whig - 1965 I have no clue how to classifi thi album , it is by turn moodi , sensual , loud and dens . It just rock . print media : 1 . neil gaiman - sandman seri yeah , they 're comic book , but it 's also a great stori . neil gaiman ha a nack for take everi myth you 've ever heard , twist it on it head , and then slap you around with it ( just for good measur ) . If you realli ca n't stomach be seen read comic , check out american god or neverwher . 2 . orson scott card - ender 's game sienc fiction for peopl who do n't like sienc fiction . A book that work on sever level , I 've read it time and again from the age of 10 or 11 and I still find reason to go back . 3 . jame ellroy - american tabloid dizzi , stream of thought narr coupl with polit , gang , cuba , drug and hollywood .

A heartbreak spiral that you can see come a mile away , but are powerless to stop . 5 . alex garland - the tesseract I know thi is an overus clich but I could n't put it down . I pick it up think that I would read until I got tire , I read the whole damn book . A bit of a puzzl ( but not a mysteri ) . intertwin stori that span sever year to explain the event of one ill-fat even . stun in content and form . perhap sometim I 'll post movi reccomend but I 've got work to get to now ! 
I miss post anyth yesterday , but hey it 's ok . I spent the major of my comput time last night captur and log footag for a coupl of promo piec that I have due thi come week . and guess what I 'm off to do now ? that 's right more captur and log . It 's thrill realli . 
I spent sever hour thi even review the footag I shot last weekend for joe . It 's onli an hour and 45 minut of footag but nearli everi bit of it is usabl . We decid to cut way down on film time by shoot detail shot and then write voice-ov for it , rather than tri to ad-lib line on locat . So far our plan ha work , but now I am face not with find the `` good '' take out of sever but with write from the ground up , use the footag that I think will be good enough for him to write bit about . It seem that while I save us a lot of time and hassl in the field I have inadvertanli creat much more work in the edit room for myself . Ah well , live and learn and all that jazz . On the plu side , it look like I get to order the firearm for the movi tomorrow ! woohoo ! that make me much more excit than it realli should . thank you damian and ryan for the great idea and support . 
see a coupl of hour ago I wa feel down , sad , mopi , blah , lone . you know , not so good . basic the onli thing that 've happen in the last hour or so are a coupl of realli good convers , and a few compliment on the last promo piec I did . that 's realli all it took to remind me that I do inde have friend and that I have been product recent . So here I am outsid of a club type away just becaus I want to share my joy . and talk to a friend ... mainli the friend thing , but you do n't feel bad about that do you ? aww babi , it 's cool , we just talkin ' . yeah that better , let me make it up to you . have an almond joy . there that better aint it ? 
I 've been have an amaz time . when I wa film at the delorean car show thi past weekend I reciev a job offer . I realli cant say too much about it until I get some more inform but it could be huge for me . Ok I know thi wa short but I 've got to do some edit befor work tonight ( 7:00 ) so I 'd better get to it . 
Ok , I 'm not actual but I did see hi new movi ! ye , I went to the 12:01 show of spiderman 2 . first off I love it . It wa a darker film than the first , and even more charact orient . pretti emot complex for a superhero movi to boot . secondli everi one in the theater wa veri attent and quiet , that never happen for me ! My onli real complaint wa the wonki sound system that overcompens for the loud in some of the action scene by drop the volum , in the middl of an explos . I 'm not sure if the amp were clip or what , but it suck when you hear booooooom . now I 'm off to tri to wind down enough to go to bed . hey , he stole that guy pizza ! trust me , it 'll be funni when you 're older . 
urllink My geek side rejoic ! Ok to be truth I do n't realli have a `` geek side '' it pretti much just all geek . I think thi is great news for the new batman movi . the studio seem to have pick up the trend of take a talent `` indi '' director and give him the reign of a big budget action . thi is becom more and more preval as of late , first there wa peter jackson get tap to do the lord of the ring movi and then sam raimi with the spiderman franchis and most recent alfonso cuaron helm the latest harri potter flick . they 've also gone with more `` indi '' actor thi time around as well . I 've onli seen cillian murphi in two movi so far but he ha blown me away in both of them , it will be interest to see how he handl thi role . most actor tend to go over the top when they play villian but murphi ha been veri humanist in hi choic in the past . At the veri least it seem like it will be a good ride . 
So I 'm think of dye my hair again . I 'm think someth realli odd thi time , mayb blue or red or green . On second thought better stay away from red , it ha the tendenc to look pink . I have n't been abl to do anyth too wild with it for a few year but now that I 'm not work for the man anymor I can do what I pleas . Do you ever find it hard to be creativ when you are sick ? yeah , I 'm feel it right now . blah . I think that sometim soon I may turn thi blog into an actual site , complet with pictur and what not . although no fourm , I 've learn my lesson about how hard those are to maintain from urllink mark , one of my favorit local comic . 
I film a one man show last night at a bar call hair of the dog . I 'm not sure if you 've ever seen anyth like thi befor . It wa truli amaz to see someon perform an hour and twelv minut of stand up bit interspers with longer stori . the crowd wa veri attent and respod well . the perform craig smith is also the organ of nashvil standup 's mock the vote campaign , which is regist voter at sever local comedi show . after the show a bunch of peopl walk over to craig 's hous ( which is about two block away ) . On the way there we kept pass cd case that had been thrown on the sidewalk , with the booklet and rear insert still in them , but ala , no actual cd remain . after pass journey , joan osbourn , and eagl ( hotel califorina ! damn heathen ! ) we stumbl across jani joplin 's greatest hit which for some reason struck the fanci of craig 's girlfriend and it wa decid that she would take it home with her . thi struck me as odd , as I know that they have that cd with a fine look case within the rank of their audio entertain . for the remaind of the even she would not inform me as to the expect fate of said case and insert . I can onli hope she will be use it as part of an art project that reveal to the viewer the danger that come in the form of the greatest hit album ! 
the urllink M. night shyamalan documentari is a hoax , there is no buri secret , it 's just a stunt to build public for urllink the villag , hi upcom movi . I for one think it 's a cool idea . I wa alway interest in orson well ' `` war of the world '' and I think thi is an evolout of that . appar a lot of peopl view it as `` untrustworthi '' becaus it wa market as a real documentari rather than a public piec . It just amaz me , that in thi age of `` realiti '' show peopl are get mad about thi stunt . Ok go check out the websit for urllink garden state . spend some time there , check out both trailer , read zach 's blog , find the hidden footag . I know I 've mention thi one befor but it look amaz . Ok , I 'm tri to figur out how to get pictur up on thi thing so expect that later on tonight , or tomorrow , depend on how lazi I am !
